Make a crisp full-screen menu (16:9 → 4096×2304) with Photopea

Goal: turn a DALL·E image (often 1024×1024 or 1536×1024) into a clean 4096×2304 (16:9) PNG that scales perfectly in Unity without stretching.

A. Prep — choose your path

If your source is already landscape (e.g., 1536×1024): we’ll expand canvas to 1792×1024 and “outpaint” the sides, then upscale to 4096×2304.

If your source is square (1024×1024): Crop to 1024×576 (16:9), then canvas-expand to 1792×1024 (optional, for extra side detail), then upscale to 4096×2304.

(DPI doesn’t matter for games — pixels do.)

B. Step-by-step in Photopea

Open Photopea → File → Open (load your image).

(Optional) Crop to 16:9

Press C (Crop tool) → in the top bar set Fixed Ratio: 16:9 → position → Enter.

Result should be something like 1024×576 (from 1024×1024) or keep 1536×1024 if already 16:9-ish.

Canvas-expand to working 16:9 (if needed)

Image → Canvas Size…

Set Width = 1792 px, Height = 1024 px, Anchor = center, Canvas extension color = Transparent → OK.

Manual “outpaint” the sides (edge stretch/fill)

Pick Rectangle Select (M). (If the tool shows Elliptical, long-press it and choose Rectangular.)

On the Background/image layer, drag a vertical strip (≈ 80–150 px) along the left edge where the art looks safe to extend.

Ctrl+C (copy) → Ctrl+V (paste). A new layer appears with that strip.

Edit → Free Transform (menu path; don’t rely on Ctrl+T if your browser hijacks it).
Drag the left handle outward to fully cover the left transparent margin. Enter to apply.

Repeat for the right side (you can also Layer → Duplicate Layer the left strip and Edit → Transform → Flip Horizontal, then move it).

Feather seams:
Select the top strip layer → click Add Raster Mask (bottom of Layers panel). Choose Gradient Tool (G), linear Black→White; drag a short gradient from the strip edge inwards so it softly blends with the original art.
Touch up with Spot Healing (J) or Clone Stamp (S) on a new layer if needed.

Upscale to final size

Image → Image Size…
Set Width = 4096, Height = 2304, Resample = Bicubic (Smoother) → OK.
(Leave DPI as-is — it’s irrelevant for Unity.)

Crispen edges slightly

Filter → Sharpen → Unsharp Mask
Amount 25–35%, Radius 0.3–0.6 px, Threshold 0–2. Subtle is key.

Export

File → Export As → PNG (keep transparency if you have any) → Save.

C. Unity import & usage (once per asset)

Select the PNG in Project → Inspector:

Texture Type: Sprite (2D and UI)

Sprite Mode: Single | Mesh Type: Full Rect

Max Size: 4096

Compression: None (best quality) or BC7 (if you need smaller size)

sRGB (Color Texture): ✔ | Mip Maps: ✖ (UI) | Filter Mode: Bilinear | Wrap Mode: Clamp

Apply.

On your Image component (the menu background):

Preserve Aspect: ✔ (this pillarboxes ultrawide instead of stretching).

If you prefer strict control, you can add Aspect Ratio Fitter → Fit In Parent with Aspect Ratio = 1.77778 (16:9).

D. Quick troubleshooting

“Copied area is empty” → Make sure the image layer is selected (not its mask), and your selection actually covers pixels; Feather should be 0 px.

Free Transform shortcut opens a browser tab → Use Edit → Free Transform from the menu instead of Ctrl+T.

Visible seams → Use wider strips, blend with layer masks + gradient, and/or a tiny Gaussian Blur along the seam on the strip layer.

Looks too soft after upscaling → Re-run Unsharp Mask (keep it conservative).

Target summary

Final export: 4096×2304 PNG

Unity: Sprite (2D and UI), Full Rect, Max Size 4096, Compression None/BC7, sRGB ✔, MipMaps ✖, Preserve Aspect ✔
