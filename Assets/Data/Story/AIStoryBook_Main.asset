    text: 'Welcome to Lake 1, World 1.


      Your first goal is to clear this lake.
      You do that by catching one of each species that live here.

      ||

      When
      you have caught them all, you will wake the wrath of the Boss Alpha Fish in
      this lake, who you will have to defeat in order to unlock Lake 2. ||


      There
      are a few problems, however. The fishing tool given to you by the galactic
      fishing museum is very weak and can only catch the most weak of fish. That
      is why you only see one species of fish in the lake currently. Your rod power
      is 10. Earn credits by fishing, and upgrade it to power 15 to unlock the next
      fish species. Good luck!'
